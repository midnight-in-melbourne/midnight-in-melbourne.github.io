    Kindred society in Melbourne truly began shortly after the Victorian gold
    rush in the mid 19th century. The Camarilla quickly established Melbourne as
    a Camarilla town and mostly remained under that sect’s control for over 150
    years. (Notable periods of unrest include the underworld-influenced anarch
    revolt during the inter-war period and a flurry of anarch activity around
    the end of the 1990s.)

    Like all Australian Camarilla cities, the Prince of Melbourne was appointed
    by the Ventrue Archon known as the Governor. In the 21st century, the Prince
    was the Governor’s own grand-childe, Lord Flinders, who was tasked with
    countering the increasing numbers of Brujah anarchs. Flinders took a
    particularly cruel and bloody approach to combatting the anarchs, which
    served not only to distance his supporters but to inspire the Brujah to take
    drastic action against him.

    The Brujah and other anarchs swelled their numbers and launched an assault
    against Flinders’ court. First launching a surprise strike against the
    Tremere, they drove the Warlocks out before turning their attention to
    Flinders and diablerised him. The resulting chaos and confusion were the
    ideal conditions for the rise of the Malkavian known as the Mad Prince Moon.
