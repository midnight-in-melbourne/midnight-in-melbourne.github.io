Without leadership or laws, diablerie began to run rampant through the
ranks of the Kindred of Melbourne. In the midst of this chaos, the Mad Prince
Moon returned. However, they were much different than remembered.
Multiple Malkavians awoke from torpor each claiming to have a piece of
Moon within them and further stated that Moon had implanted memories
into other Kindred who had survived the Curfew War. These Moon
Malkavians insisted that they were the rightful rulers of the city and that the
clans respect their position as Prince. Their words fell on mostly deaf ears.
Rather than halt the bloody tide of diablerie, the Moon Malkavians seemed
to revel in it, using it as a tool to reclaim their supposed lost memories with
the aid of a Caitiff named Fenchurch who had been specifically engineered
for this purpose. In the end, Fenchurch would marry an Aspect of Moon,
diablerising them and claiming praxis over the city as the Widowed Prince.
The Malkavians bowed to this new ruler, but the rest of the court erupted in
laughter; the one insult Moon was known not to tolerate. Where once Moon
ruled as the cityâ€™s most dangerous and feared Kindred, the remnant they had
become has become a sad and broken joke.
More and more of the city has become too difficult to hunt in as the
Masquerade continued to fracture.
