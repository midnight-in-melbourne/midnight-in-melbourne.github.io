The remaining vampires began claiming the hunting grounds abandoned by the Camarilla, resulting in territorial disputes and clan tension. This was only exacerbated by the Ministry entering the city, who were technically welcome now that it was an Anarch Free State. However, no authority existed to resolve any issues or disputes so a meeting was called to attempt to resolve these matters.

However, one attending Toreador managed to bring a most curious guest; a childe of the late Lord Flinders, who had been torporised during the fight against his sire and was discovered hidden in the Ventrue havens. This hostage was a powerful Elder, possessed of great mastery of Dominate, but their power and lineage were not enough to save them from being torn to shreds by the assembled anarchs. 

By the conclusion of the event, some nominal territories were hashed out with the Brujah taking the lion’s share, the Toreador gaining support to establish an Elysium, the Ministry staking a claim for their nefarious purposes, and the Nosferatu sending one sole delegate to grab the Melbourne underground.
