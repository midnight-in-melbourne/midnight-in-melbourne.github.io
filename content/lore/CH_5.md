Adelaide had fallen to the Camarilla. Though some (particularly the Gangrel and a prominent Toreador named Phoenix) had contributed much to the war effort, it was not enough to resist the Ivory Tower and the survivors fled to Melbourne. It was not lost on any that even a token effort by the Brujah to assist would have seen them victorious instead, yet the Brujah sent nobody.

Rather, the rabble were indulging themselves in their mastery of the city. Baron Leo allowed his clan free reign to assault and abuse the licks under his authority. Appointing himself a Judge or Magistrate rather than a Baron, he had the Priestess of the Ministry executed and diablerised for the attacks against him at the last meeting and then humiliated Lady Catherine, Keeper of Elysium, by making her sing while the Brujah threw banana peels at her. 

Once the Gangrel and other Adelaide exiles arrived, tension quickly turned to violence and the Baron and his clan were driven out. With them gone, Lillian of the Toreador assembled support enough to counter the Masquerade threat posed by March at Midnight.
