In the absence of an authority figure, the Camarilla once again sent an emissary to Elysium. This time it was not one solitary figure but a cohort of Tremere with the Nosferatu acting as escorts; the Sewer Rats had seemingly thrown their lot in with the Camarilla. But Elysium was compromised by the mysterious absence of Lady Catherine and without a Keeper the meeting could fall to chaos and violence.

Lillian stepped up and claimed the role of Keeper and thus oversaw the bloodiest and most damnable gathering of Kindred in Melbourne since the reign of the Mad Prince. Conflict constantly broke out, firearms were discharged, and at least three or four Kindred were diablerised. The Tremere even managed to conduct a sorcerous ritual which lifted whatever abominable enchantment was affecting the Mad Prince’s haven at Luna Park.

In the end, no Kindred claimed praxis over the lawless Melbourne night, the Tremere were driven out, another Masquerade breach compromised the Theatre hunting grounds, multiple Kindred had met Final Death through the worst of vampiric crimes, and something dark and terrible began to laugh.
