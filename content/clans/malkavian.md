The enigmatic Clan Malkavian are an insane collection of seers, prophets, and psychopaths. Costumes of an eccentric, medical, or unclassifiable nature will be placed here.

(NOTE: Malkavian characters will be given firm direction as we are actively trying to avoid comical characters as it can be offensive to some and can damage the tone of the event.)
