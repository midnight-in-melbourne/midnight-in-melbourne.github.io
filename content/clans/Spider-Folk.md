For the first time, a faction of non-vampires are available. The strange and alien Spider Folk are impassive and deadly shapeshifters who feed on blood much like the Kindred but are in no way related to them and have their own mysterious reasons for reaching out to the undead. Costumes that specifically reference spiders and webbing will be cast here. (NOTE: sue to the high likelihood of triggering arachnophobic reactions, we request that performers employ costumes that can cover and conceal spider features when they are not actively being employed during dramatic scenes).
