With Prince Eclipse now firmly in place as ruler of Melbourne’s Kindred, the other Camarilla
cities sent envoys to welcome him to the Ivory Tower. Sydney sent their Sheriff, Greater
Brisbane sent their Herald, and Hobart sent their Scourge. It came as little surprise that each of
these envoys were of the Ventrue clan and the line of the Governor, and it was highly suspected
that they were sent in part to pressure or intimidate this upstart Malkavian Prince.
But Eclipse was not to be intimidated. He immediately went on the political offensive,
illustrating the support of his court, forcing the Ventrue to bend the knee, and even going so far
as to question and insult the Governor. Later, several Ventrue would be slain due to accusations
of ties to the Anarch Movement (which has become an immortal sin, with capital punishment
even being acceptable within the walls of Elysium).

The Ministry continued to claim allegiance to the Camarilla and to Prince Eclipse himself,
though their Priestex was executed due to accusations of unsanctioned diablerie; the Prince
would allow one of their subordinates to perform the same crime upon them in a display of
ironic justice. Nevertheless, the Prince seemed to approve, and even allowed the Ministry to
leave his city peacefully when they asked. However, two of the Snakes remain to advise him.
But they would not leave without administering some venom. The Banu Haqim, who had failed
to support the Toreador in the past, got a taste of poison themselves when their own attempts
to maintain a hold in the city were thwarted by the serpents. And despite a noble effort by the
Ventrue to reign in the Masquerade breach the judges and roses let run unchecked, the Theatre
district remains a serious threat to the Kindred of Melbourne.
