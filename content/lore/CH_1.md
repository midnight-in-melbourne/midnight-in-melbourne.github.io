Our story begins with the vampires of Melbourne crawling out of a power vacuum, and seeking to establish a new pecking order. The Toreadors, reclaiming their traditional hold as arbiters of "Elysium", arranged for a meeting of the surviving clans to decide who would be the inheritor of the Mad King's fallen city. 

With Moon out of the picture, the collaboration quickly devolved into a struggle for power. The Brujah, who had suffered valuable losses during the Curfew War, insisted on taking the city for the Anarch Movement while the Ventrue and their Banu Haqim protectors demanded it remain Camarilla Territory. The Toreador, ever the fair-weather diplomats, hosted a meeting for the two sides to parlay. (The Nosferatu were mostly absent for the meeting having suffered egregiously during the reign of Moon.) Inevitably, negotiations soon became heated and at the stroke of midnight a bloodbath ensued. Multiple Kindred met Final Death and by dawn the Ventrue, Banu Haqim, and those Toreador (and Nosferatu) loyal to the Camarilla were driven out of the city or destroyed. The Anarch Movement had finally claimed the Worldâ€™s Most Liveable City.
