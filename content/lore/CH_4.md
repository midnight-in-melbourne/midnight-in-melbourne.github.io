The Ministry, offended by the Toreador’s inability to conduct a meeting without violence (at a supposed Elysium, no less), invited the Kindred to a meeting at their hunting grounds in Crown casino to attend the inaugural pronouncement of Baron Leo and hear his laws and edicts. Though the Baron’s ascendance was of central import, two other vital matters concerned the assembly.

The first was the death of one Gabrielle Simmons, whose violent death in the Toreador hunting grounds caused significant mortal attention and caused a potential threat to the Masquerade (a movement called March at Midnight was particularly troublesome). The second was a request from the anarchs in Adelaide to assist them in their struggle against invading forces of the Camarilla. 

Leo and his Brujah resisted considerable conflict within the court, and especially created friction with the Ministry. Though several attempts were made on the Baron’s unlife, he survived another night (partly due to some kind of ritual involving a chalice, the blood of multiple participants, and alleged sorcery.)
