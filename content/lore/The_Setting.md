<p>
    Kindred society in Melbourne truly began shortly after the Victorian gold
    rush in the mid 19th century. The Camarilla quickly established Melbourne as
    a Camarilla town and mostly remained under that sect’s control for over 150
    years. (Notable periods of unrest include the underworld-influenced anarch
    revolt during the inter-war period and a flurry of anarch activity around
    the end of the 1990s.)
  </p>

  <p>
    Like all Australian Camarilla cities, the Prince of Melbourne was appointed
    by the Ventrue Archon known as the Governor. In the 21st century, the Prince
    was the Governor’s own grand-childe, Lord Flinders, who was tasked with
    countering the increasing numbers of Brujah anarchs. Flinders took a
    particularly cruel and bloody approach to combatting the anarchs, which
    served not only to distance his supporters but to inspire the Brujah to take
    drastic action against him.

  <p>
    The Brujah and other anarchs swelled their numbers and launched an assault
    against Flinders’ court. First launching a surprise strike against the
    Tremere, they drove the Warlocks out before turning their attention to
    Flinders and diablerised him. The resulting chaos and confusion were the
    ideal conditions for the rise of the Malkavian known as the Mad Prince Moon.

   <h2 class="font-heading text-red text-3xl uppercase text-center mb-5"> Mad Prince Moon and the Curfew War</h2>

Details of the Mad Prince and their rule are vague, conflicting, and disturbing.
Moon’s demented mastery of their Disciplines allowed them to warp the minds
and memories of the city’s Kindred and subjected them to a reign of terror. What is
known for sure is limited.  </p>

  <p>
Moon was certainly a Malkavian, if they were Kindred at all, and though they called
themself a Prince they were not affiliated with the Camarilla, nor for that matter
with the Anarch Movement; their methods and motives were alien to either sect.
They allowed the Brujah, Ventrue, Toreador, Nosferatu, and Banu Haqim of the
city to remain but subjected them to horrors and humiliations that are generally
remembered only in nightmare. Most fearsome of all was their haven of Luna Park
which still remains shrouded in mystery.  </p>

  <p>
When the city underwent an extended lockdown and curfew during the covid-19
pandemic, an opportunity was found to fight back. The Toreador and Nosferatu, who
had both managed to maintain a precarious servile position, engineered a chance
for the Brujah to assault the Mad Prince’s haven. The bloodshed was only possible
with the assistance of the Ventrue, whose ties to media, government, and the police
ensured that the attack was successful and silent.  </p>

  <p>
Sanity returned to Melbourne, but most of the memories of that time are still lost
or broken. The Toreador reclaimed their traditional hold over Melbourne’s cultural
landscape and the Nosferatu were diminished and damaged, but not destroyed.
The Anarchs stepped into the turf they fought so desperately to seize, while the
Camarilla moved in to reclaim the city they once called their domain.
