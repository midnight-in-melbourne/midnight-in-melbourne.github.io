With the Toreador and Banu Haqim having abandoned Melbourne, two other clans took the opportunity to attend Elysium in hopes of replacing them. The Tremere, having failed once before to reclaim their position in the city, called upon their long loyalty to the Camarilla as proof of their sincerity in accepting Prince Eclipse’s rule and further pointed to their awakening of the Moon bloodline as aa service to the Malkavian clan. The Lasombra, new to the Camarilla after centuries of opposing it, had a more difficult task in earning trust.

A diplomat from Prince Theophania, the Toreador Prince of Adelaide, extended the offer of recognition and cordial relations with Prince Eclipse, clearly intended to broker an alliance between the only two non-Ventrue Camarilla cities in the country. However, the Ventrue seemed to be more concerned with the damage to the Masquerade the Toreador had left behind, namely in the Theatre district. They had discovered a ghost hunter who had stumbled upon the Toreador’s indiscretions and found how they had leaked incriminating evidence to mortal authorities. Through manipulation, Dominate, and an eventual Embrace, they managed to eradicate any evidence of kindred involvement and finally remove the Masquerade breach.

Despite rumours of heretical sorceries and cunning treachery, the Tremere and Lasombra earned enough trust to be permitted into Prince Eclipse’s court. Finally free of Masquerade concerns and anarch threats, Prince Eclipse had finally brought stability and safety to the vampiric underworld of the World’s Most Livable City.

But the Camarilla is filled with ruthless and ambitious kindred ever eager to tear down those who wield its authority. Despite assurances to the contrary, the Lasombra stole territory from the Prince’s own clan. The Ventrue, scions of the Governor, have further entrenched their hold over their hunting Grounds. This period of quiet may yet herald a storm.
