The first gathering under Prince Eclipse occurred at a difficult time. Half the city were too
compromised or threatened by mortal attention to be safe for hunting, and yet another would
suffer the same fate before the night was over. Nevertheless, the Kindred of Melbourne
held what could be considered the first recognisable Camarilla court since the reign of Lord
Flinders.

Prince Eclipse founded his court, honouring respected Kindred with positions of influence,
acknowledging several childer into his Domain, and granting the Ministry leave to remain
in his city as his vassals (notably appointing one of their number, Nak, as his Seneschal).
Alas, bloodshed would mar the meeting as a Malkavian assaulted a Nosferatu, much to the
frustration of the Banu Haqim. As hosts of this Elysium, they ensured that this crime was
addressed before all.

The Haqimi sorcerers further exerted their authority by insisting that suspected criminals prove
their loyalty under oath. The Seneschal took it upon himself to be the first so appraised, where
it was revealed he was a diablerist. Though the Prince found it in himself to forgive this crime,
he could not forgive the treason his own clan proved him guilty of. He was executed by the
Sherrif, Jean-Paul, with little ceremony but brutal significance.

Though the clans did well in addressing the various threats to their hunting grounds, one clan
fully neglected their duties. Trusting the Banu Haqim to clean their mess, the Toreador would
find that mortal authorities began a sweep for narcotics, abuse, and financial discrepancies
within their Theatre Hunting Grounds. As such, they would need to flee the city.
It is rumoured that the Haqimi slayed more than a few of them as they left.
