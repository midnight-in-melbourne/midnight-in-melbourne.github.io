With the threats to the Masquerade neutralised, the Melbourne domain was the most stable it had been since the rule of Lord Flinders. Prince Eclipse certainly had enemies within his court, but they seemed fractured, disorganised, and timid. The Lasombra would change all of this.

The Shadows requested audience with the Prince, claiming the right of their clan to present an Elder for justice to earn clemency for others of their kind; naturally, with blood expected to be spilled, it would be inappropriate to conduct such matters in sacred Elysium. However, the other clans suspected a trap, with even the Prince himself seemingly neglecting attendance. Such caution was well-founded, as the Prince’s Ministry Seneschal and Archmagos were ambushed and brought to Final Death while the Ventrue and Lasombra vied in battle to seize praxis. 

Eclipse then revealed he had been in disguise all evening, berated the Kindred, and vacated his throne while declaring he would return once they had brought their own ruin upon themselves. The Ventrue stepped into the role of leadership they had sought so long, and the reign of Prince Malleus King began.

As for the Lasombra, they were driven from the city, but not before the Elder they had brought was diablerised by the Malkavian called Melody; a childe of the Mad Prince Moon. Nevertheless, the darkness brought by the clan of shadows and their mysterious Elder, Father Vanya, has left a stain that continues to taint the World’s Most Liveable City.
