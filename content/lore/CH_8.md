The first official court gathering of the Widowed Prince saw a delegation of Banu Haqim from
the Camarilla attend with an invitation from the Governor for the city to join the sect. This would
also grant the Widowed Prince the curious distinction of becoming the first non-Ventrue Prince
in the country, and the fact that he was Caitiff made the offer even more notable. The Widowed
Prince accepted, but also informed his court that he desired a new bride (that he would
diablerise this spouse was assumed rather than declared).
Clearly under the crazed influence of the remnants of the Mad Prince Moon, many in the court
sought a way to oust their regent. The Malkavians sought a way to remove the aspects of Moon
from themselves and were assisted by sorcerers of the Banu Haqim in collating them into the
Widowed Prince, Fenchurch.
This proved the opportunity many were looking for to slay him, and the slaughter was initiated
by a prisoner. The Banu Haqim had brought the Brujah known as Baron Leo who once claimed
praxis over the city, giving him to the Nosferatu for loyal service to the Ivory Tower. Leo (subtly
assisted by devious conspirators) would find a way to break his bonds and attack the Widowed
Prince. In the resulting bloodbath, both would fall and many others would slink away to wipe the
blood from their hands.
Following this, the Malkavian known as Eclipse would claim praxis, though some vampires
claimed to still be plagued by visions and dreams of the Mad Prince Moon.
